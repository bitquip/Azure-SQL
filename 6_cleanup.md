## Section 5: Clean Up Resources

When you're done experimenting, it's important to clean up the resources to avoid unnecessary costs:

1. **Destroy Resources:** If you want to remove the resources you've created, run the following command:

```bash
pulumi destroy
```

2. **Confirm Deletion:** Confirm the resource deletion when prompted. This will remove the resources created in your Azure subscription.
